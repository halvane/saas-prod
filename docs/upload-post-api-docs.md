FFmpeg Editor API

Process and transform media using your own FFmpeg command safely on our infrastructure. Submit a job with your media and a command template, then poll the job until it finishes and download the result.

Endpoint

Headers

| Name          | Value                    | Description                      |
|---------------|--------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Authorization | Apikey your-api-key-here | Your API key for authentication. |

Parameters

| Name              | Type          | Required | Description |
|-------------------|---------------|----------|-------------|
| file              | File (binary) | Yes      | Media file to process. |
| full\_command      | String        | Yes      | FFmpeg command template that MUST use {input} and {output} placeholders. Example: ffmpeg -y -i {input} -c:v libx264 -crf 23 {output} |
| output\_extension  | String        | Yes      | Desired output file extension (e.g., mp4, wav, mp3, mov, webm). |

Note: If the duration of the input media cannot be detected, the system assumes 60 seconds for quota calculation.

Command Template Rules

For security and reliability, only safe FFmpeg commands are accepted.

Use placeholders: {input} (or indexed {input0}, {input1}, â€¦) for input files and {output} for the output file; do not hardcode filenames. The first input can be referenced as {input} or {input0}.

Allowed pattern starts with ffmpeg and may include typical flags (e.g., -y, -i, -c:v, -c:a, -r, -b:v, filters, etc.).

Blocked characters/constructs to prevent command injection: ;, |, &, $, \\\`\`, $(, newlines, carriage returns, and destructive commands like rm/rmdir\`.

If validation fails, the API returns 400 Bad Request with a helpful message.

Responses

202 Accepted (job created)

Check Job Status

Poll the job until it finishes.

Example response:

Statuses: PENDING, PROCESSING, FINISHED, ERROR.

Download Result

When status is FINISHED, download the processed file.

Response headers include the appropriate Content-Type and a Content-Disposition attachment filename (e.g., output.mp4, output.wav). The response body is the binary media.

Example: Convert to MP4 (H.264)

Example: Extract Audio to WAV

Concatenate/Merge multiple videos (NEW)

The API now supports multiple input files for operations like concatenation. You can use placeholders {input0}, {input1}, {input2}, etc., in full\_command.

Option A: Send multiple URLs (JSON endpoint)

Option B: Upload multiple files (multipart/form-data)

Concatenation examples

Simple concatenation (2 videos):

Concatenation with re-encoding (multiple videos):

Using the concat demuxer (no re-encoding â€” faster but requires identical formats):

First create a text file with the list of videos, upload it as file and the videos as file1, file2, etc.:

Important: The {input} placeholder still works as before (points to the first file). For multiple inputs, use {input0}, {input1}, {input2}, etc.

Limitation: The predefined presets (h264\_social, hevc\_social, copy\_mux) and ffmpeg\_args only support a single file. For multiple inputs, you must use full\_command.

Quotas by Plan (minutes of media/month)

| Plan          | Minutes/Month |
|---------------|----------------|
| free          | 30             |
| basic         | 300            |
| professional  | 1000           |
| advanced      | 3000           |
| business      | 10000          |

Resets on the 1st of each month at 00:00 UTC.

Errors

400 Bad Request: Invalid or unsafe FFmpeg command, missing parameters.

401 Unauthorized: Invalid or expired API key.

404 Not Found: Job not found.

429 Too Many Requests: Monthly quota exceeded (response includes current usage when applicable).

500 Internal Server Error: Processing error.

Notes

Jobs are asynchronous; always poll the job status before attempting to download the output.

Quota checks use detected media duration to ensure fair usage across plans.

| title      | String | Yes      | Default title/caption of the post                                                                   |
| description    | String | No       | Optional extended text used on TikTok photo descriptions, LinkedIn commentary, Facebook descriptions, Pinterest notes, and Reddit bodies. Ignored elsewhere. |
| scheduled\_date | String (ISO-8601) | No | Optional date/time (ISO-8601) to schedule publishing, e.g., "2024-12-31T23:45:00Z". Must be in the future (â‰¤ 365 days). Omit for immediate upload. |
| async\_upload  | Boolean | No      | If true, the request returns immediately with a request\_id and processes in the background. See Upload Status. |
| first\_comment | String | No       | Automatically post a first comment after publishing. Supported on Instagram, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Bluesky. On X (Twitter) and Threads, this creates a reply to the main post. For X threads, the comment is posted as a reply to the last tweet in the thread. |

Important: If you set async\_upload to false but the upload takes longer than 59 seconds, it will automatically switch to asynchronous processing to avoid timeouts. In that case, use the request\_id with the Upload Status endpoint to check the upload status and result.

Scheduling behavior: When you provide scheduled\_date, the API responds with 202 Accepted and includes a job\_id. That same job\_id will later appear in Upload History to correlate the scheduled job with the publish record.

Video Support (Mixed Carousels):

Instagram & Threads: You can upload videos in the photos\[] array to create mixed carousels (photos + videos).

All other platforms (Facebook, TikTok, LinkedIn, X, Pinterest): Do NOT upload videos to this endpoint. Use the Upload Video endpoint instead. Uploading videos here for these platforms will result in an error.

Platform-Specific Titles

The title parameter serves as a fallback. To set a custom title for a particular platform, use the optional \[platform]\_title parameter. If provided, it will override the main title for that platform.

Example Optional Parameters:

instagram\_title: "Check out my latest reel on Instagram! #reels"

The global description field is ignored for X photo uploads.

How X (Twitter) Thread Creation Works (Advanced Logic)

Note: The following describes the default thread creation logic. To override this and post long text as a single post, set the x\_long\_text\_as\_post parameter to true.

The system is engineered to create well-formatted, natural-looking threads on X (formerly Twitter). Instead of simply splitting text at every line break, it intelligently groups paragraphs to create more readable tweets.

Here's the step-by-step logic:

Intelligent Paragraph Grouping (Primary Method):

The function first identifies distinct paragraphs (any text separated by a blank line).
It then combines as many of these paragraphs as possible into a single tweet, filling it up to the 280-character limit without exceeding it. The double newline (\n\n) between combined paragraphs is preserved for formatting.
This results in fewer, more substantial tweets that flow naturally, just as if a person had written them.

Handling Exceptionally Long Paragraphs:

If a single paragraph is, by itself, longer than the 280-character limit, a more granular splitting logic is automatically triggered for that paragraph only:

Split by Line Break: The system first attempts to break the paragraph down by its individual line breaks (\n).

Split by Word: If any of those single lines are still too long, it will split them by words as a final resort.

Media Attachment:

For posts that include photos or videos, all media is attached only to the first tweet of the thread. The subsequent tweets in the thread will be text-only replies.

How Twitter Threads Are Created

If your text in the title field is longer than 280 characters, our API automatically creates a Twitter thread. You don't need to do anything special. By default, x\_long\_text\_as\_post is false.

How it works:

Our system creates natural-looking threads by intelligently splitting your text:

It groups paragraphs: The system combines as many paragraphs (text separated by a blank line) as possible into a single tweet without exceeding the character limit.

It splits long paragraphs: If a single paragraph is too long for one tweet, it's split into smaller parts. The system first tries to split by line breaks and then by words.

This process ensures your threads are easy to read.

Example of a thread creation

If you send this text in the title:

The API will create a thread like this:

Tweet 1:

This is the first paragraph. It is short.

This second paragraph is a bit longer. Our API tries to keep paragraphs together in one tweet.

Tweet 2:

This is a much longer third paragraph. It probably won't fit with the others. It might even be too long for a single tweet. If so, the API will split it. It will first look for line breaks.

Tweet 3:

If a single line is still too long, it will split it by words. This creates a readable and well-structured Twitter thread automatically.

Facebook

| Name             | Type   | Required | Description                                                       | Default |
|------------------|--------|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|
| facebook\_title   | String | No       | Specific text for the Facebook post. Fallbacks to title.        | title |
| facebook\_page\_id | String | Yes      | Facebook Page ID where the text will be posted.                   | -       |
| facebook\_link\_url | String | No       | Optional URL to include for link preview in text posts. If provided, it's sent as link to the Graph API and Facebook may render a preview card. | -       |

Note: If facebook\_page\_id is not provided, we will automatically use the user's only connected Page (if exactly one exists). If multiple Pages are connected, the API returns a helpful error with an available\_pages list so you can choose one. Posting to personal Facebook profiles via API is not supported by Meta; only Pages can be posted to.

Threads

| Name                        | Type    | Required | Description                                                                                                                              | Default |
|-----------------------------|---------|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|
| threads\_title             | String  | No       | Specific text for the Threads post. Fallbacks to title.                                                                                | title |
| threads\_long\_text\_as\_post | Boolean | No       | If true, long text is published as a single post. If false (default), a thread is created if the text exceeds 500 characters.        | false |

Note: To upload content to Threads, specify the platform as "threads" in the platform\[] array.

How Threads Are Created

If the text you provide exceeds 500 characters and threads\_long\_text\_as\_post is false, our API will automatically create a thread on Threads, similar to how it works with X (Twitter).

How it works:

Our system creates natural-looking threads by intelligently splitting your text:

It groups paragraphs: The system combines as many paragraphs as possible into a single post without exceeding the character limit.

It splits long paragraphs: If a single paragraph is too long for a post, it is split into smaller parts, first trying to break by line breaks, and if that's not enough, by words.

This process ensures that your Threads are coherent and easy to read, replicating the functionality you already enjoy for X.

Reddit

| Name       | Type   | Required | Description                                                        | Default |
|------------|--------|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|
| subreddit  | String | Yes      | Destination subreddit, without r/ (e.g., python).              | -       |
| flair\_id   | String | No       | ID of the flair template to apply to the post.                     | -       |

If you provide the global description field, it becomes the Markdown body of the Reddit post; otherwise we post only the title.

Note: To upload content to Reddit, specify the platform as "reddit" in the platform\[] array.

Bluesky

| Name | Type | Required | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| bluesky\_title | String | No | Specific text for the Bluesky post. Fallbacks to title. | title |
| reply\_to\_id | String | No | URL or AT-URI of the post to reply to. Creates a reply to the specified post. | - |

Note: To upload content to Bluesky, specify the platform as "bluesky" in the platform\[] array. The maximum character limit is 300 characters per post.

How Bluesky Threads Are Created

If your text exceeds 300 characters, our API automatically creates a Bluesky thread. This works similarly to X (Twitter) and Threads.

How it works:

Our system creates natural-looking threads by intelligently splitting your text:

It groups paragraphs: The system combines as many paragraphs (text separated by a blank line) as possible into a single post without exceeding 300 characters.

It splits long paragraphs: If a single paragraph is too long for one post, it's split into smaller parts. The system first tries to split by line breaks and then by words.

Example of a thread creation

If you send this text in the title:

The API will create a thread like this:

Post 1:

This is the first paragraph. It is short.

This second paragraph is a bit longer. Our API tries to keep paragraphs together.

Post 2:

This is a much longer third paragraph. It probably won't fit with the others. If so, the API will split it into multiple posts automatically.

Upload Video

Upload video to various social media platforms using this endpoint.

Endpoint

Headers

| Name | Value | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| Authorization | Apikey your-api-key-here | Your API key for authentication |

Common Parameters

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| user | String | Yes | User identifier |
| platform\[] | Array | Yes | Platform(s) to upload to (e.g., "tiktok", "instagram", "linkedin", "youtube", "facebook", "twitter", "threads", "pinterest", "bluesky") |
| video | File | Yes | The video file to upload (can be a file upload or a video URL) |
| title | String | Yes | Default title of the video |
| description | String | No | Optional extended text used only on LinkedIn commentary, Facebook descriptions, YouTube descriptions, and Pinterest notes. Ignored elsewhere. |
| scheduled\_date | String (ISO-8601) | No | Optional date/time (ISO-8601) to schedule publishing, e.g., "2024-12-31T23:45:00Z". Must be in the future (â‰¤ 365 days). Omit for immediate upload. |
| async\_upload | Boolean | No | If true, the request returns immediately with a request\_id and processes in the background. See Upload Status. |
| first\_comment | String | No | Automatically post a first comment after publishing. Supported on Instagram, LinkedIn, Facebook, YouTube, and Bluesky. On X (Twitter) and Threads, this creates a reply to the main post. For X threads, the comment is posted as a reply to the last tweet in the thread. On YouTube, it posts as a top-level comment on the video. |

Important: If you set async\_upload to false but the upload takes longer than 59 seconds, it will automatically switch to asynchronous processing to avoid timeouts. In that case, use the request\_id with the Upload Status endpoint to check the upload status and result.

Scheduling behavior: When you provide scheduled\_date, the API responds with 202 Accepted and includes a job\_id. That same job\_id will later appear in Upload History so you can correlate the scheduled job with the eventual publish record.

Platform-Specific Titles

The title parameter serves as a fallback. To set a custom title for a particular platform, use the optional \[platform]\_title parameter. If provided, it will override the main title for that platform.

Example Optional Parameters:

instagram\_title: "Check out my latest reel on Instagram! #reels"

facebook\_title: "Excited to share this new video with my Facebook friends and family."

tiktok\_title: "New TikTok video just dropped! ðŸ”¥"

linkedin\_title: "A professional insight on the latest industry trends, discussed in this video."

x\_title: "New video out now! ðŸ“¢"

youtube\_title: "My new YouTube video is live!"

pinterest\_title: "An inspiring video pin."

How X (Twitter) Thread Creation Works (Advanced Logic)

Note: The following describes the default thread creation logic. To override this and post long text as a single post, set the x\_long\_text\_as\_post parameter to true.

The system is engineered to create well-formatted, natural-looking threads on X (formerly Twitter). Instead of simply splitting text at every line break, it intelligently groups paragraphs to create more readable tweets.

Here's the step-by-step logic:

Intelligent Paragraph Grouping (Primary Method):

The function first identifies distinct paragraphs (any text separated by a blank line).
It then combines as many of these paragraphs as possible into a single tweet, filling it up to the 280-character limit without exceeding it. The double newline (\n\n) between combined paragraphs is preserved for formatting.
This results in fewer, more substantial tweets that flow naturally, just as if a person had written them.

Handling Exceptionally Long Paragraphs:

If a single paragraph is, by itself, longer than the 280-character limit, a more granular splitting logic is automatically triggered for that paragraph only:

Split by Line Break: The system first attempts to break the paragraph down by its individual line breaks (\n).

Split by Word: If any of those single lines are still too long, it will split them by words as a final resort.

Media Attachment:

For posts that include photos or videos, all media is attached only to the first tweet of the thread. The subsequent tweets in the thread will be text-only replies.

Video Format Requirements

This document outlines the video format requirements for uploading to various social media platforms via the API.

Automatic Video Transformation

Our API automatically transforms videos to adapt them to the specifications of each social network. However, if you use this feature, the upload will take longer because the transformation is performed first before uploading to the platforms.

If you prefer faster uploads, you can pre-process your videos according to the specific requirements of each platform outlined in this document.

Video Encoding Compatibility

Some video creation tools occasionally produce videos with encoding that Meta's systems don't accept. At times, their output needs to be re-encoded for compatibility.

One Solution: Re-encode with FFmpeg

If your video uploads are failing, try re-encoding the video using FFmpeg, an open-source tool for video processing:

This command converts your video to use the widely-compatible H.264 video codec and AAC audio codec, which Meta platforms accept.

Re-encoding "normalizes" your video to use standard encoding parameters that Meta's platforms are designed to process, without sacrificing quality. If you see these errors regularly, this simple step can save you frustration when sharing your creative content.

Upload-Post allows you to receive real-time notifications about your upload statuses. This is particularly useful for asynchronous uploads or scheduled posts where you don't receive an immediate confirmation of the final publish status in the API response.

Configuration

You can configure notifications in the Upload-Post Dashboard:

Configure Notifications

You can choose to receive notifications via:

Webhook: A POST request sent to your server with a JSON payload.

Telegram: A message sent to a configured Telegram chat.

Configuration via API

You can also configure your notification preferences programmatically using the API.

Endpoint: POST https://app.upload-post.com/api/uploadposts/users/notifications

Authentication: Requires a valid API Key.

Request Body:

Response:

Webhook Payload

When an upload process completes (whether successfully or with a failure), Upload-Post sends a POST request to your configured webhook URL. The request body is a JSON object containing details about the event.

Example Payload

Field Descriptions

| Field | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| event | string | The type of event. Currently, upload\_completed. |
| user\_email | string | The email address of the user who initiated the upload. |
| profile\_username | string | The username of the profile associated with the upload. |
| platform | string | The social platform where the post was uploaded (e.g., instagram, youtube, tiktok). |
| media\_type | string | The type of media uploaded (video, photo, or text). |
| title | string | The title provided for the post. |
| caption | string | The caption or description of the post. |
| result | object | An object containing the outcome of the upload attempt. |
| result.success | boolean | true if the upload was successful, false otherwise. |
| result.url | string | The direct URL to the published post (if available and successful). |
| result.publish\_id | string | The ID assigned to the post by the platform. |
| result.error | string | A description of the error if the upload failed. |
| created\_at | string | The timestamp of the event in ISO 8601 format. |

Usage Notes

Idempotency: While we strive to deliver each notification exactly once, you should handle potential duplicate events based on your own unique identifiers if necessary (though post\_id or publish\_id can serve this purpose for successful posts).

Security: Ensure your webhook endpoint is secure (HTTPS) and verify the data as needed for your application logic.

Airtable Integration

Manage your video uploads to social media platforms directly from Airtable.

Set Up

Running Airtable Automation Scripts requires a paid Airtable plan that includes automations with scripts.

This guide shows you how to automatically upload videos to social media platforms from Airtable via Upload-Post.

Gather Your API Key

Start by getting your API Key from your Upload-Post account in the "API Keys" section. This key will be used in the script.

Be sure you have configured your social media accounts in Upload-Post before proceeding.

:::info
URL Support for Media Files: You can now pass URLs for both photo and video uploads instead of binary files. Simply provide the direct URL to your media file in the video or photos\[] parameter.
:::

Create an Airtable Workspace

In Airtable, create a new workspace with these fields:

Title as Single Line Text

Platforms as Multi Select with types: tiktok, instagram

Video as Attachment

User as Single Line Text

Status as Single Line Text

Enter Test Video Data

Add sample data to test the integration:

Title: Enter a title for your video

Platforms: Select one or more platforms (tiktok, instagram)

Video: Attach a video file (MP4 format recommended)

User: Enter your username

Status: Enter pending (lowercase)

Build an Automation Script

Let's create an Airtable automation script that uploads videos via Upload-Post:

Add Trigger

In your workspace, click on Automation then +New automation

Name the automation

Click Choose a Trigger

Select When a Record is Created

Select your table

Click Done

Add Action

Click Add Action

Select Run Script

Delete any default code in the script editor

Copy and paste this code:

Replace Your API Key with your actual Upload-Post API key.

Test the Script

In the script editor, press >Test

The script will run and process any pending records. If successful, you'll see your videos being uploaded to the selected platforms, and the Status field will update to "success".

Security Best Practices

Never share your API key

Consider using environment variables where possible

Review records before processing large batches

--- END OF docs/guides/airtable-integration.md ---


--- START OF docs/guides/async-uploads.md ---

Avoid Timeouts with Asynchronous Uploads

Are your requests taking too long and resulting in timeouts? For video, photo, or text post uploads that may require more processing time (file processing, social network publishing queues, etc.), use the async\_upload parameter to make your request asynchronously.

How does it work?

Send your request with async\_upload=true to the appropriate upload endpoint.

The API will immediately respond with a request\_id.

Use this request\_id to check the progress and result at the status endpoint.

Relevant Endpoints

Text upload: POST /api/upload\_text

Video upload: POST /api/upload

Photo upload: POST /api/upload\_photos

Upload status: GET /api/uploadposts/status?request\_id=\<REQUEST\_ID>

Quick Example: Asynchronous Video Upload

API Error Handling: Upload Endpoints

This document explains the structure of responses you will receive from the Video Upload (POST /api/upload) and Photo Upload (POST /api/upload\_photos) endpoints, including how success and errors are indicated.

1\. Successful Request Processing (HTTP 200 OK)

When your upload request is successfully processed by our server (meaning your authentication was valid, input was generally okay, and usage limits weren't exceeded before starting), you will always receive an HTTP 200 OK status code.

The JSON response body will look like this:

Key Points:

"success": true indicates the API server processed your request.

"results": This dictionary is crucial. It contains the outcome for each individual platform you requested.

Platform Success: If results\[platform].success is true, the upload to that platform likely succeeded. Additional platform-specific IDs (like publish\_id, container\_id, post\_id) may be included.

Platform Failure: If results\[platform].success is false, the upload to that specific platform failed. The results\[platform].error field will contain a message explaining the reason (e.g., token expired, API error from the platform, file issue).

Important: An error on one platform (like LinkedIn in the example) does not stop attempts on other platforms. Always check the success flag for each platform in the results.

"usage": Provides information about your current API usage count and limit after this request.

2\. Request Failure (Non-200 HTTP Status Codes)

If there's a fundamental problem with your request before we attempt to upload to individual platforms, you will receive an HTTP status code other than 200 OK. The response body will typically look like this:

Here are common error status codes and their meanings:

400 Bad Request

Meaning: Your request was malformed or missing required information.

Common Causes: Missing video or photos file, missing title, invalid platform name, missing user identifier in the form data when required.

message examples: "Video file and title are required", "Title cannot be empty", "Username required", "Invalid platforms: \[platform\_name]", "Username not associated with any profile".

401 Unauthorized

Meaning: Authentication failed.

Common Causes: Missing Authorization header, using an invalid or expired API Key or Bearer Token.

message examples: "Authorization header required", "Invalid or expired token", "Invalid API key", "API key expired".

404 Not Found

Meaning: The user associated with your authentication could not be found in our system.

message example: "User not found".

429 Too Many Requests

Meaning: You have exceeded an API usage limit.

Common Causes: Reaching your monthly upload limit, or (for Professional plan users) reaching the daily upload limit for a specific social media account.

message examples: "You have reached your monthly limit of X uploads", "You have reached the daily limit of 5 uploads for: Instagram (account\_name)".

500 Internal Server Error

Meaning: An unexpected error occurred on our server while processing your request.

message example: Usually contains technical details about the error. If you encounter this repeatedly, please contact support.

Limit of uploads

Social Hard Caps Per Network

To protect your connected accounts and stay compliant with each social network, Upload-Post enforces platform hard caps using a rolling 24-hour window. When a cap is reached for a specific account on a given network, further posts to that account/network are rejected until the window rolls over.

What counts toward the cap: only successful publishes recorded for that account/network in the last 24 hours.

Scope: Per connected social account. These limits are NOT global to your Upload-Post user.

Example: If you manage 5 Profiles, and each Profile has its own TikTok account connected, you get the full limit for each TikTok account. (e.g., 5 TikTok accounts Ã— 15 posts = 75 posts per day total).

Scheduled posts: caps are re-checked at execution time; if the cap is already reached, the publish will be rejected then.

Recommended and enforced daily caps

| Social Network     | Hard Cap (posts per 24h) |
| :----------------- | -----------------------: |
| Instagram          |                       50 |
| TikTok             |                       15 |
| LinkedIn           |                      150 |
| YouTube            |                       10 |
| Facebook           |                       25 |
| X (Twitter)        |                       50 |
| Threads            |                       50 |
| Pinterest          |                       20 |
| Reddit             |                       40 |
| Bluesky            |                       50 |

Error response when the cap is reached

Status: 429 Too Many Requests

Body example:

What else the verifier checks

Duplicate/similar content within 48h (per account/network) to reduce spam risk and shadow bans.

Mention limits to avoid spammy behavior (e.g., excessive mentions or repeating the same handle too frequently).

Media and content sanity checks evolve over time to align with network guidelines.

Make Integration

Upload-Post provides seamless integration with Make (formerly Integromat) for automated video publishing workflows. This guide walks you through connecting your Upload-Post account with Make in 3 simple steps.

Getting Started with Upload-Post

Create an account or log in to your existing Upload-Post account

Navigate to the "API Keys" section

Generate an API key for your Make integration

API Configuration

For Make integration, you'll need to configure an HTTP module with the following parameters:

Note: Find your API key in your Upload-Post Manage API Keys section.

:::info
URL Support for Media Files: You can now pass URLs for both photo and video uploads instead of binary files. Simply provide the direct URL to your media file in the video or photos\[] parameter.
:::

Form Data Configuration & Make.com Setup

Configure your Make HTTP module with these parameters:

| Field | Value | Required |
| ----- | ----- | -------- |
| title | Your video title | Optional |
| user | Your username | Required |
| platform\[] | tiktok | Required |
| video | Binary file | Required |

Make.com Configuration Steps:

Add an HTTP Module: In your Make.com scenario, add an HTTP module and choose the "Make a Request" action.

Configure the Request Settings:

Method: Set to POST.

URL: Enter https://api.upload-post.com/api/upload.

Headers: Add a header with:

Key: Authorization

Value: Apikey \[YOUR\_API\_KEY]

Set the Request Body: Change the body type to multipart/form-data and add the following form fields:

title: Set the value to your desired title (you can use a variable if needed).

user: Enter your username you set in Upload-Post.

platform\[]: Set the value to tiktok.

video: Attach the binary file (your video file). Make sure this field is mapped to the binary data you want to send.

Save and Test: Save your scenario and run a test to ensure that the video upload works correctly via the API.

Advanced Configuration Options

For Instagram Uploads

To upload to Instagram instead, simply change the platform value to instagram in your form data.

Uploading to Multiple Platforms

To upload to both TikTok and Instagram simultaneously, add both platform values by creating multiple fields with the same name platform\[] in the Make.com HTTP module.

Securely Storing API Keys in Make.com

For better security, avoid hardcoding your API key directly in scenarios:

Create an App Key in Make.com

Store your Upload-Post API key as a constant

Reference the constant in your HTTP module headers

When sharing scenarios, use scenario blueprints which do not expose your keys

Example of referencing an API key constant in Make:

Error: {"code":"reached\_active\_user\_cap"}

If you've encountered this error, don't worry. This is not an issue with your account, your content, or our platform's stability. It's a temporary limitation from the TikTok API.

This error means that the daily limit of active users allowed by TikTok for our application has been reached.

What is a "Daily Active User"?

In this context, a "daily active user" is anyone who uses our application to interact with the TikTok API on a given day. TikTok sets a cap on how many unique users can do this through a single application (like ours) within a 24-hour period.

What should you do?

Your account and content are safe. This is not a penalty or a block on your account.

The best solution is to wait and retry. The user cap is reset by TikTok every 24 hours. We recommend waiting a few hours before trying to post again.

If the error persists for more than 24 hours, please try again the next day.

Why does this happen?

To manage their platform's resources, TikTok imposes a daily usage quota on every application that connects to its API. Due to the rapid growth of our user community, we are sometimes hitting this maximum allowed number of daily users.

What are we doing about it?

We are actively working on a solution. We are in direct communication with TikTok's developer support team to request an increase in our daily user quota.

Unfortunately, the timeline for this increase is determined by TikTok, and we cannot expedite their internal review process. We appreciate your patience as we work to resolve this for good.

Thank you for your understanding. We are committed to providing a reliable service and are doing everything we can to support our growing community.

White-label Integration Guide

Profiles diagram

This guide explains how to integrate Upload-Post directly into your own platform. This allows your users to connect their social media accounts securely through Upload-Post, enabling your platform to manage their profiles and posts via the API on their behalf.

Integration Flow Overview

The core idea is to create a unique profile within Upload-Post for each user on your platform who wants to connect their social accounts. You then generate a special, secure URL that the user visits to link their accounts. Once linked, your platform can interact with the Upload-Post API using the user's unique identifier.

Step-by-Step Integration

Step 1: Create a User Profile

For each user on your platform, you need to create a corresponding profile in Upload-Post. This is done by making a POST request to the /api/uploadposts/users endpoint.

Requirement: You must provide a unique username in the request body. This username should be a stable identifier that links the Upload-Post profile back to the user on your platform (e.g., your internal user ID).

Authentication: Remember to include your Authorization: ApiKey YOUR\_API\_KEY header.

Result: The API will respond with details of the created profile, confirming the username.

âž¡ï¸ See details: Create User Profile API Reference

Step 2: Generate the Secure JWT URL

Once the profile exists, you need to generate a secure URL that your user will use to connect their social media accounts. Make a POST request to the /api/uploadposts/users/generate-jwt endpoint.

Requirement: In the request body, provide the same unique username (from Step 1). You can also include the following optional fields:

redirect\_url: A URL to which the user will be redirected after linking their account.

logo\_image: A URL to a logo image for branding on the linking page.

redirect\_button\_text: (Optional) The text to display on the redirect button after linking. Defaults to "Logout connection".

connect\_title: (Optional) Custom title text for the connection page.

connect\_description: (Optional) Custom description text for the connection page.

platforms: (Optional) List of platforms to show for connection. Defaults to all supported platforms.

show\_calendar: (Optional) Whether to show the calendar view on the connection page. Defaults to true.

Authentication: Include your Authorization: ApiKey YOUR\_API\_KEY header.

Result: The API will return a JSON object containing an access\_url. This URL contains a secure token (JWT) valid for 48 hours.

âž¡ï¸ See details: Generate JWT URL API Reference

Step 3: User Connects Accounts

Redirect your user to the access\_url obtained in Step 2. This URL will open the Upload-Post connection interface, guiding the user through the process of securely connecting their desired social media accounts (like Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, etc.) to their profile.

Enhanced Connect Experience:

Professional Navigation: Tab-based interface for easy switching between account connection and calendar view

Calendar View (if enabled): Users can view their scheduled posts and upload history directly from the connect page

Customizable Interface: You can control the branding, title, and available features through the JWT parameters

Secure OAuth Flows: Upload-Post handles all authentication and token storage securely

The connection URL is valid for 48 hours, giving users ample time to complete the linking process.

Step 4: Manage User Content via API

After the user successfully connects their accounts in Step 3, your platform can now use other Upload-Post API endpoints to manage content on their behalf.

When making calls to endpoints like Upload Photo or Upload Video, you will typically include the user's unique username (the one you used in Step 1 and 2) in the request parameters to specify which profile's connected accounts should be used.

You can also retrieve the list of profiles and their connected accounts using the GET /api/uploadposts/users endpoint.

âž¡ï¸ See details: Get User Profiles API Reference

Authentication

All API requests related to user profile management (/api/uploadposts/users and /api/uploadposts/users/generate-jwt) require authentication using your API Key. Include it in the Authorization header for every request:

Replace YOUR\_API\_KEY with the actual API key provided to you.

(Note: The /api/uploadposts/users/validate-jwt endpoint uses Bearer token authentication, as detailed in its specific documentation).

Next Steps

With the user profiles created and accounts linked, explore the other API references to start managing content:

Understanding YouTube API Quota Limits

âš ï¸ DEPRECATED:
We have now received our own dedicated YouTube API quota. You no longer need to configure your own Google Cloud project. All YouTube features are available directly from our platform without any extra setup.

We believe in being transparent with our community about the challenges we face and the solutions we implement. This document explains the current situation regarding YouTube's API quota and introduces a new feature that gives you more control.

The Challenge: YouTube's API Quota

Every application that interacts with YouTube, including ours, is subject to a daily API quota. This quota determines how many actions (like uploads, comments, or data requests) can be performed through our platform each day.

Due to the incredible growth of our user base, we are frequently reaching the limit of our current quota. This can sometimes result in temporary service disruptions for YouTube-related features.

What We Are Doing About It

For the past six months, we have been in ongoing discussions with YouTube's leadership team to request a significant increase in our daily quota. We believe a higher quota is essential to reliably serve our growing community.

Unfortunately, this process has been slower than anticipated, and we are still awaiting a final decision. We are persistently following up and providing all necessary information to make our case.

Our Solution: Use Your Own Google Cloud Project

To provide a stable and reliable solution while we wait for the quota increase, we have implemented a new feature: you can now connect your own Google Cloud project to our application.

By doing this, you will use your own personal YouTube API quota instead of our shared, limited quota.

Benefits of This Approach:

Reliability: You are no longer affected by our shared quota reaching its limit. As long as your personal quota has not been exceeded, your YouTube actions will succeed.

Control: You have full visibility and control over your own API usage through your Google Cloud Console.

No More Waiting: This immediately solves the issue for you, without having to wait for our negotiations with YouTube to conclude.

How to Connect Your Own Google Cloud Project

Here is a step-by-step guide to connect your own project and use your personal API quota:

Go to the Google Cloud Console.

Create a new project or select an existing one.

Enable the YouTube Data API v3 for your project. You can find this in the "APIs & Services" > "Library" section.

Navigate to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials".

Click "Create Credentials" and select "OAuth client ID".

If prompted, configure the "OAuth consent screen":

Select "External" for the user type.

Provide an app name (e.g., "My Upload-Post Connection"), your user support email, and developer contact information. You can use your own email address for all fields.

For the "Application type", choose "Web application".

Under "Authorized redirect URIs", click "ADD URI" and paste the following URL:

Click "Create". You will now see your Client ID and Client Secret.

Copy these credentials. You will need to enter them into our application to complete the connection.

After obtaining your Client ID and Client Secret, you can securely enter them in your account settings within our application to finalize the connection.

Thank you for your patience and understanding. We remain committed to resolving the quota issue at the platform level and will keep you updated on our progress.

U: undies, unbalanced

V: valentinesday

W: workflow

Y: youngmodel, yolo

If your content includes any of these hashtags, remove them before submitting your request to avoid validation errors.

API Considerations

Upload-Post validates payload sizes before sending them to social networks whenever limits are known. Requests that exceed the documented limits return a validation error.

Some platforms might truncate overlong text instead of rejecting it (Meta products and YouTube occasionally do this). Inspect the per-platform response inside results to confirm the final content.

For channels with strict limits such as X, consider shortening URLs in your application prior to calling the Upload-Post API.

Updates and Changes

Social networks regularly adjust their limits. We keep this page aligned with the latest behavior we observe in production, but you should also:

Check Upload-Post API responses for detailed error messages about rejected posts.

Subscribe to our release notes for platform updates.

Revisit this reference periodically, especially before large content campaigns.

Common Errors

Here you'll find a list of common errors you might encounter when using the API and how to solve them.

Facebook

Error validating access token: Sessions for the user are not allowed because the user is not a confirmed user

This error from Facebook means that your Facebook profile has not been fully verified. This can happen for a few reasons:

You haven't verified your email or phone number with Facebook.

Your account is restricted for security reasons.

Facebook requires additional verification from you.

Solution

To solve this, you need to confirm your Facebook account. Follow these steps:

Log in to Facebook: Go to www.facebook.com and log in to your account. If you see any security prompts, please complete them.

Confirm your Email or Phone Number:

Go to Settings & Privacy > Settings.

Navigate to Personal Details under the Accounts Center.

Check if your email and phone number are verified. If not, follow the instructions to receive a confirmation code and verify them.

Check for Account Restrictions:

Visit Facebookâ€™s Account Quality page.

Look for any account restrictions or actions you need to take. Follow the instructions to resolve any issues.

Log Out and Log Back In:

Log out of your Facebook account.

Clear your browser's cache.

Log back into Facebook.

Reconnect the App:

Go to your Facebook Business Integrations.

Find and remove our application.

Go back to our platform and try to connect your Facebook account again, making sure to grant all the necessary permissions.

If you continue to have issues, please contact Facebook Support for assistance.

For more details, you can check out this guide.

Instagram

400: Session Invalid

This OAuthException indicates that Instagram cannot validate the session during the linking process with a third-party app. It typically appears as {"error\_type":"OAuthException","code":400,"error\_message":"Session invalid"} and is often caused by expired tokens, residual permissions, conflicts in authorized apps, or temporary issues with the Instagram API.

Solution

Disconnect and reconnect the app: From Instagram go to Settings > Security > Apps and Websites and remove the problematic integration; then retry the link from the external platform.

Try a private/incognito window or a different browser: Clear cookies/cache or use an incognito window to avoid session conflicts.

Switch device or network: Try from a mobile device instead of desktop, or switch networks (Wiâ€‘Fi to mobile data) to work around transient issues.

Check the account type: Ensure the account type (personal, creator, or business) meets the integration requirements.

Wait and retry: If it's a temporary API issue, wait a short time and try again.

Contact support: If none of the above works, contact the external platform's support and, if appropriate, report the issue to Meta/Instagram.

Reference: Based on the article "Understanding and Resolving the "400: Session Invalid" Error When Linking Instagram" from Postly Blog (Postly blog post).

YouTube

Failed to fetch YouTube channel info

This error occurs when the connection to your YouTube account is not configured correctly. The most common reason is that the YouTube Data API is not enabled for your account in the Google Cloud Console.

Solution

To fix this, you need to enable the YouTube Data API v3.

Go to the Google Cloud Console.

Make sure you are in the correct project.

Go to APIs & Services > Library.

Search for "YouTube Data API v3".

Click on it and make sure it is Enabled. If it's not, click the "Enable" button.

Once enabled, try reconnecting your YouTube account.
